This app is my 'senior project' for Eleven Fifty Academy's Web Development program. 

v2.0 wll include public API calls to Discogs, Spotify and Youtube. v1.0 is a shell and database entries currently must be a user's manual input.

The DJs Assistant will eventually be a disc jockeys best friend. Users will be able to view data points of every kind for every song under the sun. Users can enjoy an embedded Youtube video to associate with each track.

The project's development was a messy process! But one I definitely enjoyed and relished. 

I had enormous plans for this app when it was assigned to me, though as the deadline approached I adjusted my goals to became much more realistic.

If I could do it over again I would have saved all that time and hard work on the public APIs for v2.0. Considering those mistakes and the lost time, I'm very happy with how my project turned out.

LEGACY code is commented out at the bottom of every client file.
